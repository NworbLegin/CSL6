CSL List of ThingsToDo

Broken demo fcns:
	IFFT synthesis - only works w FFTW
	Remez FIR planning code broke
	Multi-tap delay demo mixer?
	Sample-avg filter
	HRTF only works w FFTW
	VBAP threading broken
	MIDI I/O demos still being ported (dump works)
	Audio I/O demos still being ported

Windows issues:
	Some code not accepted by MS C compiler:
		Variable-size array decl in VBAP.cpp
		e.g., unsigned speakerMapping[numSpeakers];
		ToDo: re-write these to use ptrs and malloc.

Bugs:
	Block resizer up-sampling
	Env as scaled
	Moog filter
	ADSR/AR time scaling - setDuration should not scale whole envelope

Unfinished:
	InOut channel conversion handling

Improvements:
	ExpSeg and Spline envelopes
	Add symmetrical filter constructors (cf/bw as floats/UGens)
	Copy constructors all around

New features:
	SampleRateConvertor and support for multiple rates in a graph

Meta-issues
	Doc, doc, and more doc (CSL tutorial?)
