<H4>Purpose</H4>
<DL>
<DT>
Read a line of text from a file
</DL>
<H4>Description</H4>
This routine retrieves a line of input from a file.  This routine reads
characters until a newline is encountered.  The newline is not returned.
The return value is a pointer to the text string or NULL if end-of-file is
encountered.
<H4>Parameters</H4>
<DL>
<DT>
&lt;-  char *FLgetLine
<DD>
Pointer to the text string.  This is NULL if end-of-file is encountered
and the line is empty.  Otherwise, when end-of-file is encountered, the
line is treated as if it were terminated with a newline.  The text string
is in an internally allocated storage area; each call to this routine
overlays this storage.
<DT>
 -&gt; FILE *fp
<DD>
