Fill in a directory for a file name from a list of paths
</DL>
<H4>Description</H4>
This routine fills in a directory path name for a file name from a list of
directories.  The intended purpose of this routine is to fill in the
directory path from a list of defaults prior to opening the file.  If the
input file name specifies any directory components, the output name is set
to the input name.  If the input file name is a simple file name (no
directory components), each path from the list is used in turn as a directory
path.  A check is made to see if the corresponding file can be found.  The
file name of the first file found is returned.  If the search for such a file
is unsuccessful, the input name is returned.  Note that this behaviour
effectively puts the current directory at the end of the list of paths.  The
user can specify a search of the current directory in some other order, by
including the current directory in the list of paths.  The current directory
can be specified as "." or as an empty specification.
<P>
For Unix sytems this routine performs the additional service of expanding
home directory specifications of the form "~" or "~USER" which appear as the
first component of the path name in the input name or in one of the paths in
the list of paths.  In the case of the input name containing a home directory
specification, the resulting expanded name will then have a directory
component and no further search using the list of paths will occur.  If
the home directory cannot be found (unknown user, for instance), the "~"
specification is treated as part of an ordinary filename string.
<P>
The path name list is a white-space or colon (semicolon for Windows)
separated list of paths.  For example, ":/usr/users/usera/:~userb".  The
path names can have an optional trailing / character.  This specification
includes the current directory as the first element of the list.
<P>
The list of path names can be specified directly in the Dlist variable, or
Dlist can specify the name of an environment variable (signalled by a leading
$ character) which contains the list.
<H4>Parameters</H4>
<DL>
<DT>
&lt;-  int FLpathList
<DD>
Number of characters in the output string
<DT>
 -&gt; const char Fi[]
<DD>
Character string containing the file name
<DT>
 -&gt; const char Dlist[]
<DD>
Input character string containing a list of directories, or the name of
an environment variable (including a leading $).  If Dlist specifies an
environment variable, the value of this variable supplies the list of
directories.
<DT>
&lt;-  char Fo[]
<DD>
Character string containing the file name.  At most FILENAME_MAX
characters including the terminating null are returned.  This string can
overlay the input string if desired.
