<H4>Purpose</H4>
<DL>
<DT>
Find the correlation coefficient for a vector and its reversal
</DL>
<H4>Description</H4>
This procedure returns a value which indicates whether a given array of
values is symmetric or anti-symmetric.  The correlation coefficient for
the vectors x[i] and x[N-1-i] is calculated as
<PRE>
        SUM x[i] x[N-1-i]
  rho = ----------------- .
            SUM x[i]^2
</PRE>
<P>
An alternate interpretation is in terms of the even (symmetric) and odd
(anti-symmetric) parts of a vector,
<PRE>
  xe[i] = 0.5 (x[n] + x[N-1-i]),
  xo[i] = 0.5 (x[n] - x[N-1-i]).
</PRE>
Then
<PRE>
        SUM xe[i]^2 - SUM xo[i]^2
  rho = ------------------------- .
        SUM xe[i]^2 + SUM xo[i]^2
</PRE>
If the vector is symmetric (x[i] = x[N-1-i]), rho is +1.  If the vector
is anti-symmetric (x[i] = -x[N-1-i]), the result is -1.  All other cases
fall in between.
<P>
A test for near symmetry or near anti-symmetry is suggested by
<PRE>
              SUM xo[i]^2     SUM xe[i]^2
  rho = 1 - 2 ----------- = 2 ----------- - 1.
              SUM x[i]^2      SUM x[i]^2
</PRE>
Declare the vector to be near-symmetric if rho &gt;= 1 - 2 eps, where eps is
the relative energy in the odd part of the vector. Similarly, declare the
vector to be near-anti-symmetric if rho &lt;= -(1 - 2 eps), where eps is the
relative energy in the even part of the vector.  Choosing a small value for
eps, a suitable test for near symmetry or near anti-symmetry is
<PRE>
   (int) (1./(1.-2.*eps) * rho).
</PRE>
This returns +1 for a near symmetric vector, -1 for a near anti-symmetric
vector and 0 otherwise.
<H4>Parameters</H4>
<DL>
<DT>
&lt;-  double VRfCorSym
<DD>
Correlation coefficient in the range -1 to +1.  If the vector has all
zero coefficients, the value 0 is returned.
<DT>
 -&gt; const float x[]
<DD>
vector of doubles (N elements)
<DT>
 -&gt; int N
<DD>
Number of elements in the input array
