Windows MSVC project:
  A Windows MSVC project for libtsp is in the MSVC folder.

Building on Unix Systems:
  Building on Unix systems, in the main directory,
    % make
  This will be create the library file lib/libtsp.a.

Using the library routines:
  To use the libtsp routines in a program you will have to link with the
  object library libtsp.a.  Furthermore, user programs need access to the
  header file libtsp.h.

Man page files:
  The directory man contains man pages for the top level libtsp routines.
  These man pages have been automatically generated from the corresponding
  file header and so contain the same information as the file header itself.
  The extensions for the man pages are .3tsp.  On some systems, these will have
  to be renamed to have an extension of .3 in order for the man program to
  recognize them.

html files:
  The directory html contains html files for top level libtsp routines.  These
  html pages have been automatically generated from the corresponding file
  header and so contain the same information as the file header itself.

Test programs:
  Below each of the subdirectories of libtsp is a test directory containing
  test programs that exercise the libtsp routines.  Makefile's in those
  directories will build the test programs and compare the output with a
  reference output.

Other files:
  A number of routines are hidden one level down in a "nucleus" directory.
  These are internal routines usually not of interest to the end user.

  A number of audio files of various formats can be found in the
  audiofiles directory.
